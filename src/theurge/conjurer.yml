      <p>You can use a standard action to summon a spirit or elemental next to
      you instead of attacking. This action provokes opportunity attacks and
      can&rsquo;t be used while hampered, like a ranged spell would. Describe
      your summon in any way that makes sense for your particular character. You
      can only have one such summon active at a time. The summon dissipates
      harmlessly after it attacks, if it is hit by an attack or at the end of
      the battle, whichever comes first.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p>The summon counts as your ally, but can&rsquo;t be healed. It uses your
      actions, and generally moves alongside you to stay next to its conjurer if
      you move. As a quick action you might be able to order the spirit to move
      and attempt to accomplish something other than attacking, but it probably
      requires a skill check to do so. If it is attacked, it uses your defenses,
      and is destroyed in a single hit (it still took one for the team, so it
      wasn&rsquo;t completely useless).&nbsp;</p>

      <p>As an interrupt action, you can have your summon intercept a foe moving
      to engage you, stopping its movement before attacking it with your most
      damaging magic attack (it doesn&rsquo;t provoke opportunity attacks with
      it, it just dissipates after attacking). Alternatively, as a quick action
      on your turn you can have your summon attack a nearby enemy instead. You
      can apply your other talents to the summon&rsquo;s attack, as if you were
      attacking yourself.</p>

      <p>This talent is mainly useful to keep foes off you, but can sometimes
      burn a turn where otherwise you would not be able to attack. Oh, and
      conjuring your summon outside of battle to e.g. have it
      &ldquo;scout&rdquo; a corridor full of traps costs you a recovery
      (don&rsquo;t complain, you still get to trigger the traps from a safe
      distance). You can conjure it for free amidst the adrenaline rush of
      battle, but it is not meant to let you trivialize exploration.</p>
